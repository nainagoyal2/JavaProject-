Variable syntax:
====================

datatype variablename=value
int x=100;

method syntax:
====================
accssmodifier returntype methodname()
{

}


public void show()
{

}

Data types
------------
Type casting

Primitive to Object(valueOf())

primitive Object to primitive(intValue())

String object to primitive (parseInt())

primitive to String Object(valueOf)

this keyword
================
user to refer current class instance variable and instance method

-this keyword used to differentiate between instance and local variable
-used invoked method
-used to invoked any constructor
-used to invoked any class instance


========================
	This Keyword,Super keyword & final keyword
	we can use in inheritance

This keyword is used to refer current class variable,method and constructor.

Super Keyword
============================
1.Super keyword can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
2.Super keyword can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
3.Super keyword can be used to call immediate parent class constructor.(super())

final Keyword
======================================
final keyword can be apply for variable,method and class
1.If we apply final keyword to variable then that variable will be consider constant variable
(value will become fix...no one can update)
2.If we apply final keyword to method then we cant override that method in other class or child class
3.If we apply final keyword to class then we can not extend that class into another class.
===============================================================
IQ: How we can implement immutable class ,variable or method in java?
Ans: Using final keyword.
==============================================================


1.Abstarct class
===============
1.In abstract class we can have both abstract method and non abstarct
 (concreate) Methods.
2.Abstract method and class we can declare using abstract keyword.
3.Abstract class can not be instantiated.
4.Abstract methods must be overriden by class which inherits abstract class.
5.Using Abstract class partial abstraction is possible.

Interface
===========
1.An interface in java is a blueprint of a class. 
2.Interface contains final and static variables.
3.Interface contains abstract methods.
4.An abstract method is a method contains definition but not body.
5.Methods in interface are public by default.
6.Interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance.
7.We can define interface with interface keyword.
8.A class extends another class, an interface extends another interface
 but a class implements an interface.
9.We can create Object reference for Interface but we cannot instantiate interface.
10.Inheritance use extends keyword and Interface use implements keyword.
















Object
==============
classname ref_variablename=new constructor();

Class A
{
}

Object
============
A a1=new A();



next () and nextLine method differce
